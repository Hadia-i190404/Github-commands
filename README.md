A simple explanation and understanding of some of the basic github commands
Git is a version control system. A version control system is a tool that allows us to maintain different versions of a project while working on it as an individual or in a team. It also adds new features as the project progresses. This allows you to easily revert to any version of the project that you want without any problems. Github is a for-profit company owned by Microsoft which allows people to host their repositories online and manage those repositories.
Git is a great tool that can be used without the command line. With some of its clients, you can learn about the actions of the client in the background. This helps you understand how it works. For this purpose, i have discussed some of the basic and important GitHub commands,

# git init
The first step in creating a Git repository is to turn a directory into an empty one. After running the init command, you can add and commit files and directories.
# git add
The add command is used to add files to the staging area of Git. Before a file can be added to a repository, it needs to be included in the Git index. There are a variety of ways to use this command, such as adding entire directories or specific files.
# git commit
Make changes to the files and keep track of them in a local repository. Each commit has a unique ID, making it easy to reference. It is recommended to include a message with every commit to explain the changes that were made in it. This helps to find out what changed and understand it.
# git status
The repository's current state is returned by this command.
The current working branch is returned by this command. If a file is not in the staging area but is still committed, it shows with the status. On the other hand, if there are no changes, the working directory clean will return nothing.
# git config
There are many settings and configurations that can be used in Git. One of the most important is the user.name and user.email settings. These values are used to set the email address and name of the user that will be used to commit to the repository. With the --global flag, the settings are applied to all the repositories on a computer. In addition to the usual variables, there are also many other options that can be used in the configuration of git. These include changing the output colors and the status of the repository.
# git branch
This command is used to determine which branch the repositry is on. Github also allows one to add or remove a branch to the repository.
# git merge
With the merge command, you can combine the changes made in one branch with those made in another. For instance, you can merge the changes in a staging branch with the changes in the stable branch.
# git clone
To create a working copy of a remote repository, you can use the Git clone command to copy and download it to a computer. Doing so will allow you to access the repository's history and files.
# git push
The push method sends local commits to a remote repository. There are two parameters that are required for the process: the branch that the pushes for and the remote repository.
# git pull
Run the "git pull" command to get the latest version of the repository. This will pull the changes to the local computer.
# git rm
With the command rm, you can remove directories or files from the working index. There are two options: force and cached. The former takes the file out, while the latter keeps it. When removing a directory completely, a recursive command is required.
# git remote
To connect a remote repository to a local one, the name of the repository should be set. This will prevent the user from remembering the repository's URL.
